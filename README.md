# Privacy Policy for autoLLM

_Last updated: August 2025_

## Overview
autoLLM is a Shopify app that automatically generates and maintains an **LLMs.txt** file for your store. We take your privacy seriously and are committed to handling all data responsibly.

## Information We Collect
- **Shop information**: We access basic store data such as store name, domain, description, and public content (products, pages, collections, blogs).  
- **Configuration settings**: We store app-specific preferences you set in the dashboard (for example, which content types to include or which crawlers to allow).  
- **No customer data**: We never access or store your customers’ personal or payment information.  

## How We Use Information
- To generate and refresh your store’s **LLMs.txt** file.  
- To apply your chosen app configuration.  
- To maintain redirects and ensure your file remains accessible.  
- To monitor usage against your plan limits.  

## Data Storage
- Data is stored securely using Shopify’s APIs and our cloud database.  
- Only the minimum necessary data is stored to operate the app.  
- We do not sell, share, or disclose your information to third parties.  

## Data Retention
- Your store data is retained only while you use the app.  
- If you uninstall autoLLM, all stored data (including configuration, file references, and hashes) is permanently deleted.  
- To fully remove files and redirects from your store, you should first click **“Remove file & redirects”** in the app before uninstalling. If you skip this step, daily updates stop and your LLMs.txt may remain accessible until deleted.  

## Your Rights
- You can update or remove your configuration data at any time from the app dashboard.  
- You can uninstall the app at any time, which deletes all stored data.  
- You can contact us at **support@autoblogger.bot** with any privacy-related questions or requests.  

## Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy from time to time. Updated versions will be published in the app’s GitHub repository and take effect immediately.
